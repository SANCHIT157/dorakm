      description="This is not just a pocket; it's Doraemon's primary and most iconic feature. It's a small, checkered pouch on his stomach that acts as a portal to a four-dimensional space. From this pocket, Doraemon can retrieve an almost infinite number of futuristic gadgets, tools, and contraptions. It defies the laws of physics, holding items far larger than its apparent size and allowing Doraemon to access them instantly. It's the source of all solutions (and often new problems) in the series."
